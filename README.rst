Description
===========

FEniCS-Shells is an open-source library that provides finite element-based
numerical methods for solving a wide range of thin structural models (beams,
plates and shells) expressed in the Unified Form Language (UFL) of the `FEniCS
Project <http://fenicsproject.org>`_.

**FEniCS-Shells is compatible with the 2019.1.0 release of the FEniCS Project**.

FEniCS-Shells is described fully in the paper:

Simple and extensible plate and shell finite element models through automatic
code generation tools, J. S. Hale, M. Brunetti, S. P. A. Bordas, C. Maurini.
*Computers & Structures*, 209, 163-181, `doi:10.1016/j.compstruc.2018.08.001
<https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruc.2018.08.001>`_.

Getting started
===============

1. Install FEniCS by following the instructions at
   http://fenicsproject.org/download. We recommend using Docker to install
   FEniCS. However, you can use any method you want to install FEniCS.
2. Then, clone this repository using the command::

        git clone https://bitbucket.org/unilucompmech/fenics-shells.git

3. If you do not have an appropiate version of FEniCS already installed, use a Docker container 
   (skip the second line if you have already an appropiate version of FEniCS installed)::
        
        cd fenics-shells
        ./launch-container.sh
        
4. You should now have a shell inside a container with FEniCS installed.  Try
   out an example::

        python3 setup.py develop --user
        cd demo
        ./generate_demos.py
        cd documented/reissner_mindlin_clamped
        python3 demo_reissner-mindlin-clamped.py

   The resulting fields are written to the directory ``output/`` which
   will be shared with the host machine. These files can be opened using
   `Paraview <http://www.paraview.org/>`_.

5. Check out the demos at https://fenics-shells.readthedocs.io/.

Documentation
=============

Documentation can be viewed at http://fenics-shells.readthedocs.org/.


Automated testing
=================

We use Bitbucket Pipelines to perform automated testing. All documented demos
include basic sanity checks on the results. Tests are run in the
``quay.io/fenicsproject/stable:current`` Docker image.

Features
========

FEniCS-Shells currently includes implementations of the following structural
models:

- Kirchhoff-Love plates,
- Reissner-Mindlin plates,
- von-Kármán shallow shells,
- Reissner-Mindlin-von-Kármán shallow shells,
- non-linear and linear Naghdi shells with exact geometry.

Additionally, the following models are under active development:

- linear and non-linear Timoshenko beams,

We are using a variety of finite element numerical techniques including:

- MITC reduction operators,
- discontinuous Galerkin methods,
- reduced integration techniques.
